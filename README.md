# ZeroNet JS
A JS version of ZeroNet

What works:
 Well, nothing at the moment

WIP:
 - The protocol

ToDo:
 - Everything else

# Running
Just run `client.js` and it should connect to localhost:15411 and get the content.json of HelloZeroNet (that's all it does for now)

# Certificate
That will be useful later
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -config cert.conf << .
