# ZeroNet JS
A JS version of ZeroNet

What works:
 Well, nothing at the moment

WIP:
 - ZeroNet Protocol
 - TLS
 - Basic Protocol functions
 - Server

ToDo:
 - Everything else

# Running
Just run `zeronet.js` and it should connect to localhost:15411
and get the content.json of HelloZeroNet
and also start a server

# Certificate
That will be useful later
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -config cert.conf << .






.
```
