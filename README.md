# ZeroNet JS

A JS version of ZeroNet

What works:

-   Well, nothing at the moment

Stuff that might work:

-   Basic Protocol functions (response and cmd)
-   Server (listening and accepting connections)

WIP:

-   ZeroNet Protocol
-   TLS

ToDo:

-   Everything else

# Notes

It is not planned to support protocol version v1. Only v2+ will be supported.

# Running

Just run `zeronet.js` and it should connect to localhost:15411
and get the content.json of HelloZeroNet
and also start a server
